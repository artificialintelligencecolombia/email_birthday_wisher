# email_birthday_wisher

This application has been developed for automate the sending of emails to those contacts who are celebrating birthday. Each email sent has been customized in such a way that it calls the person by his name in the email.

1. Get the current date and store it in a python data type (set: unordered, unchangeable, unindexed)
2. Open the contacts dataset and read the the information, format it in pandas df.
3. Create a loop that compares the current date with the dataset dates.
4. Create the function that send the email

## Guidelines
1. Update the birthdays.csv
2. Check if today matches a birthday in the birthdays.csv
3. If step 2 is true, pick a random letter from letter templates and replace the [NAME] with the person's actual name from birthdays.csv
4. Send the letter generated in step 3 to that person's email address.
